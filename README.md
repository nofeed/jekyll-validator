# JekyllValidator

JekyllValidator is a gem that helps you validate the output of your Jekyll website every time it's generated. I got the idea from my blog post ["Automating HTML Validation for a Happier Life"], which includes a simple bash script to automate the process. I created this plugin to enhance the platform I use with better functionality. I incorporated CSS Validation to achieve this, using a language that I adore.

## Usage

Add the following to your site's Gemfile

    gem 'jekyll-validator'

And add the following to your site's _config.yml

    plugins:
        - jekyll-validator

It is possible to exclude files from the validation process:

    validator:
        exclude: 
            - 'assets/css/main.css'
